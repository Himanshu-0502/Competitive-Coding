# Competitive Programming

Welcome to my Competitive Programming repository! This collection features a variety of algorithms and data structures that I have used throughout my competitive programming journey. Written in C++, this template is designed to help you quickly and efficiently tackle a wide range of problems commonly encountered in Competitive Programming.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Data Structures**: Implementations of commonly used data structures such as DSU, Segment Tree, Lazy Propagation, and more.
- **Algorithmic Solutions**: A collection of various algorithms, including Graph and Tree Algorithms, Hashing and Matching Algorithms.
- **Mathematical Utilities**: Classes and Functions for Combinatorics and Number Theory often required in Competitive Programming.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Himanshu-0502/Competitive-Programming.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd Competitive-Programming
   ```
   
## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank the competitive programming community and all the programmers whose code, tutorials, and problem-solving strategies have greatly inspired and guided me.
